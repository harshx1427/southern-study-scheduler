Study Scheduler

​Southern study group scheduler will simplify forming and managing study groups based on a subject, schedule, and shared goals. 
The application is designed for Southern Connecticut State University students and creates a collaborative environment 
that encourages peer to peer support across different courses and departments.  

​Students frequently struggle to locate and run study groups that meet their needs in academic settings. 
The process may become chaotic and ineffective in the absence of a centralized system.
A platform that makes it simple for users to start and find study groups and gives administrators the ability to efficiently manage
users and listings is required to make this better. The system shown in the class diagram is based on this requirement for more efficient coordination and supervision. 

​ 

​The Southern Study Group Schedular will let users: 

​Create listings to schedule study group. 

​Search for available study groups by subject, location, or time. 

​Join existing study groups that match their interests. 

​Edit or delete their own listings as needed. 

​View study group details such as group size, meeting time, and location. 

​Allow administrators to manage users and monitor group listings.
