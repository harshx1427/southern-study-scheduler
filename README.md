Southern Study Group Scheduler

​Southern study group scheduler will simplify forming and managing study groups based on a subject, schedule, and shared goals. 
The application is designed for Southern Connecticut State University students and creates a collaborative environment 
that encourages peer to peer support across different courses and departments.  

Students often have trouble finding and joining study groups that suit their needs, 
leading to chaos without a centralized system. A platform is needed to simplify creating
and locating study groups while allowing administrators to manage users and listings efficiently. 
The class diagram outlines this system for better coordination and oversight.

​The Southern Study Group Schedular will let users: 

​Create listings to schedule study group. 

​Search for available study groups by subject, location, or time. 

​Join existing study groups that match their interests. 

​Edit or delete their own listings as needed. 

​View study group details such as group size, meeting time, and location. 

​Allow administrators to manage users and monitor group listings.
